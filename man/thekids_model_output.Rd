\title{Generate Model Output for Specified Model Type}
\usage{
thekids_model_output(model, by = NULL, data = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object produced by \code{thekids_model} or another modeling function.}

\item{by}{The main predictor of interest.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables to be used in the model.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the output method for the specific model type.}
}
\value{
Output specific to the fitted model type, as determined by the appropriate
output method (e.g., summary or custom output).
}
\description{
This function identifies the type of the fitted model and chooses the appropriate
method to produce model output.
}
\details{
This function acts as a wrapper, delegating the call to the appropriate
output method based on the class of the model object. The actual behaviour
is determined by the specific method implementation for the model type.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `model` is a fitted model object
# thekids_model_output(model)
