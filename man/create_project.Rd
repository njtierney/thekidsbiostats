\arguments{
\item{project_name}{A string. The name of the project to create.}

\item{ext_name}{A string. The type of project to create. Defaults to \code{"basic"}. The extension must be available in the package's \verb{ext_proj/_extensions/} directory.}

\item{data_raw}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a \code{data_raw} directory will be created in the project. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a \code{data} directory will be created in the project. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{admin}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, an \code{admin} directory will be created in the project. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{reports}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a \code{reports} directory will be created in the project. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{docs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a \code{docs} directory will be created in the project. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{other_folders}{Vector of strings that contain any other folders that should also be created. Elements should be unique. Default \code{NULL}.}

\description{
This function creates a directory structure for a new project based on a specified extension.
It can also create additional folders such as \code{data_raw}, \code{data}, \code{admin}, \code{reports}, and \code{docs}.
The function copies specific files and folders from the chosen extension to the project directory.
}
\details{
This function helps set up the structure of a new project using a predefined extension and
optional additional directories. It ensures that the selected extension is valid by checking
the available extensions from the \code{thekidsbiostats} package. After creating the necessary folders,
the function copies the appropriate files from the package extension into the project.

For a more thorough example, see the \href{../doc/project_workflow.html}{vignette}.
}
\note{
Ensure that the \code{thekidsbiostats} package is installed and contains the required extension
in \verb{ext_proj/_extensions/}.
