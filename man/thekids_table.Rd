\arguments{
\item{x}{a table, typically a data.frame, tibble, or output from gtsummary}

\item{font.size}{the font size for text in the body of the table, defaults to 8 (passed throught to set_flextable_defaults)}

\item{font.size.header}{the font size for text in the header of the table, defaults to 10}

\item{line.spacing}{line spacing for the table, defaults to 1.5 (passed through to set_flextable_defaults)}

\item{padding}{padding around all four sides of the text within the cell, defaults to 2.5 (passed throught to set_flextable_defaults)}

\item{colour}{a colour palette from The Kids branding, options include "Saffron", "Pumpkin", "Teal", "DarkTeal", "CelestialBlue", "AzureBlue", "MidnightBlue", or "CoolGrey", defaults to 'CoolGrey'}

\item{zebra}{puts and alternating 'colour then white' theming onto the table, based on the selected colouring (defaults to \code{F})}

\item{highlight}{a numeric vector indicating which rows are to receive a colour highlight, based on the selected colouring (defaults to \code{NULL} giving no highlighted rows)}

\item{font_family}{string containing the font family to apply to the table. Default "Barlow", otherwise "sans".}

\item{...}{other parameters passed through to \code{\link[flextable]{set_flextable_defaults}}}

\value{
a flextable class object that will display in both html and word output
}
\description{
A function that accepts tabular data, in a range of formats, and outputs an object of class \code{flextable()} (intended) for display in html and word documents.
}
\details{
The purpose of this function is easily coerce many different table structures in a consistent format (look and feel), with The Kids branding applied, that ultimately will look nice in either an html or word output.

Default settings produce a relatively compact table, to avoid reports becoming excessively lengthy.

The output can be piped (\verb{\%>\%}) into further \code{flextable()} functions for advance customisation of the appearance.

Currently the function works well with input in the form of data frames, tibbles, dplyr pipes (think \code{summarise()}), \code{gtsummary()} outputs. \code{kable()} output is not currently supported in general.
}
\note{
Errors may be encountered if the input to the function (kable/gtsummary/flextable) has already received a lot of processing (merging cells, aesthetic changes). The intention is that these things would occur after running \code{thekids_table()}.

Font family must be installed at a system level, otherwise the default ("sans") will be applied.

Pre-specified formatting applied to 'flextable' objects (ahead of \code{thekids_table()}) may not carry over as expected. Please consider using \code{thekids_table() }in place of an explicit \code{flextable()} call, because our function already coerces the table to a flextable object.
